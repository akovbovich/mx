MXALIAS

MXALIAS is a simple database manager for user-defined MX aliases.  It creates
the MX alias database and lets the user add, remove, and list defined
aliases.

Using MXALIAS, short, easy-to-remember addresses like JOE can be equated to
cumbersome e-mail addresses like smithjb@node1.cluster.school.edu.  Once an MX
alias is defined, mail can be addressed be simply prefixing the alias name with
MX%:

<LITERAL>
MAIL> SEND
To:     MX%JOE
Subj:   whatever.....
<LARETIL>

A major advantage of using MXALIAS instead of VMS logical names is that MX
aliases are only used by MX, whereas logical names are primarily used for file
specifications.  Using logical names for mail addresses can cause some
unexpected error messages when trying to create a file whose name matches a
mail logical name.

To run MXALIAS, just type MXALIAS at the DCL prompt ($). Extensive on-line help
for MXALIAS is available by typing HELP at the MXalias> prompt.
