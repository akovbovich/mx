Using_Aliases

Once an MX alias has been added to the MX alias database, it can be used on the
VMS Mail "To:" line by simply prefixing the alias name with MX%.  MX will check
every address that does not include the "@" character to see if it is an MX
alias. For example, if JOE is defined as an alias, the following "To:" line
would be specified:

<LITERAL>
|MAIL> SEND
|To:     MX%JOE
|Subj:	....
<LARETIL>

Sending to MX%"JOE@localhost" will prevent MX from performing the alias
translation.

<TOPIC>
Displaying_Translations

To see the resulting addresses used by MX for all MX% addresses,
define the logical MX_VMSMAIL_SHOW_ADDR as TRUE:

<LITERAL>
|$ define mx_vmsmail_show_addr true
|$ mail
|
|MAIL> SEND
|To:     MX%JOE, MX%"MX-List@WKUVX1.BITNET", SYSTEM
|  MX rewrote alias JOE as <SYSTEM@WKUVX1.BITNET>
|  MX rewrote MX-List@WKUVX1.BITNET as <MX-List@WKUVX1.BITNET>
|Subj:   ....
<LARETIL>

The MX_VMSMAIL_SHOW_ADDR works regardless of whether or not MX aliases are
specified.

<TOPIC>
Setting_MX_as_Default_Mail_Transport

The undocumented VMS Mail command SET TRANSPORT can be used to make MX
the default transport for all mail messages.  The format of the command is:

<LITERAL>
MAIL> SET TRANSPORT MX%
<LARETIL>

The MX% prefix can be omitted from MX aliases when the default transport
has been set.  Note that non-alias "user@domain" addresses must still be
prefixed.

The MAIL command SET NOTRANSPORT can be used to disable the default
transport.

<NOTE>
The SET TRANSPORT command is undocumented; its behavior could change
in a future release of VMS.
<ETON>

.!
<MAIN>
ADD

The ADD command is used to add an MX alias to the MX alias database.

Format:
<FORMAT>
MXalias> ADD alias address[,...] [description]

<TOPIC>
Parameters

<PARAMETER>
alias

<PTEXT>
Specifies the alias to be defined.  The alias is a string of up to 20
alphanumeric characters (plus $, -, _, and .) that is equated to the given
e-mail address. The alias is the address given to MX from the VMS Mail "To:"
line using a format like MX%alias.  All aliases are converted to uppercase.
<TXETP>

<PARAMETER>
address

<PTEXT>
Specifies the e-mail address to which the alias is equated.  The address must
be a valid RFC-822 address in the format "user@domain".  If the domain is
omitted, it defaults to the local host name (as defined by the
MX_VMSMAIL_LOCALHOST logical name).  The maximum length of the address is 255
characters.  To maintain the case of an address, double-quotes must
surround the address.  Double-quotes must also be used if the address
contains the "bang" character (!).

If the address includes quotes, the address should be quoted and the inside
quotes doubled: """node::user""@domain".

You can supply multiple addresses by separating the addresses with commas.
The maximum length of a comma-separated list of addresses is 255 characters,
including the commas.
<TXETP>

<PARAMETER>
description

<PTEXT>
Specifies a description for the alias and address.  A text string of up to 255
characters may be given.  Double-quotes must surround the string if it contains
any blanks.  The description is displayed by the DIRECTORY command; it is not
included in the RFC-822 headers of any mail messages.
<TXETP>

<TOPIC>
Examples

The following examples demonstrate how an address is added to the MX alias
database.

<LITERAL>
|1.  MXalias> ADD JOE SYSTEM "Local system manager"
|    Added alias JOE to MX alias database
|    MXalias>
<LARETIL>

<ETEXT>
This example defines JOE as an alias for the local SYSTEM account.  VMS Mail
addressed "To:" MX%JOE will be delivered to <system@local-host>.
<TXETE>

<LITERAL>
|2.  MXalias> add mx-list mx-list@wkuvx1.bitnet "MX support list"
|    Added alias MX-LIST to MX alias database
|    MXalias>
<LARETIL>

<ETEXT>
This example defines MX-LIST as an alias for the MX support mailing list on
WKUVX1.BITNET.  VMS Mail addressed "To:" MX%MX-LIST will be sent to
<MX-LIST@WKUVX1.BITNET>.
<TXETE>

<LITERAL>
|3.  MXalias> ADD YYZ """NODE1::JOE""@YYZ.COM"
|    Added alias YYZ to MX alias database
|    MXalias>
<LARETIL>

<ETEXT>
This example defines YYZ as an alias for an address that includes quotes.
<TXETE>

<LITERAL>
|4.  MXalias> ADD THEM "Joe@YYZ.COM","Rick@SWAN.Com","X@Y"
|    Added alias THEM to MX alias database
|    MXalias>
<LARETIL>

<ETEXT>
This example equates three addresses with the alias THEM.  Mail addressed to
THEM will be forwarded to all three addresses.
<TXETE>

.!
<MAIN>
DIRECTORY

The DIRECTORY command provides a list of aliases or information about
an alias or a group of aliases.  The default alias directory listing
includes the alias and the description.  Wildcards can be used to display
aliases matching a particular string.

Format:

shown.
<QUALIFIER>
/OUTPUT

/OUTPUT=file.ext

<MAIN>
HELP

MXALIAS is a simple database manager for user-defined MX aliases.  It creates
the MX alias database and lets the user add, remove, and list defined
aliases.

The MX alias database filename defaults to MX_ALIAS_DATABASE.DAT in SYS$LOGIN:.
The logical MX_ALIAS_DATABASE can be defined to point to another directory
or file specification.

MXALIAS will automatically create the MX alias database the first time an
alias is added.  The user is prompted for confirmation before a new database
is created.
.!
<MAIN>
MODIFY

The MODIFY command is used to change the address or description associated with
an MX alias.

Format:
<FORMAT>
MXalias> MODIFY alias [/qualifier]

<TOPIC>
Parameters

<PARAMETER>
alias

<PTEXT>
Specifies the alias to be modified.  The alias must already be in the MX alias
database.

<QUALIFIERS>
<QUALIFIER>
/ADDRESS

/ADDRESS=text

Specifies the new e-mail address to which the alias is equated.  The address
must be a valid RFC-822 address in the format "user@domain".  If the domain is
omitted, it defaults to the local host name (as defined by the
MX_VMSMAIL_LOCALHOST logical name).  The maximum length of the address is 255
characters.  Double-quotes must surround the address to maintain its case.

You can supply multiple addresses by separating the addresses with
commas and surrounding them with parentheses. The maximum length of a
comma-separated list of addresses is 255 characters, including the
commas.
<QUALIFIER>
/DESCRIPTION

/DESCRIPTION=text
/NODESCRIPTION

Specifies a new description for the alias and address.  A text string of up to
255 characters may be given.  Double-quotes must surround the string if it
