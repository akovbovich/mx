FILESERV information
--------------------

FILESERV is a file distribution service that uses electronic mail
facilities to deliver files.  To communicate with FILESERV, send an
E-mail message to:
                      {fileserv}@{host}

Commands are sent in the body of the message you send to FILESERV.
Several commands may be sent at one time; just put one command per line.

FILESERV Commands:

    SENDME package       Sends all parts of the specified package.
    SENDME package.n     Sends part 'n' of the specified package.

    LIST [pattern]       Gives brief description of all packages
                         matching "pattern".  If pattern is omitted,
                         a description of all packages is sent.

    ADDRESS <addr>       Specifies a valid address that is to be
                         used instead of the "From:" address for any
                         files sent.  Useful when addresses arrive
                         in an invalid format.  The output from any
                         commands specified after the ADDRESS line
                         is sent to that address.

    QUIT                 Ignore all remaining lines following QUIT.
                         Used to prevent interpretation of signatures.

    HELP                 Sends this file.

Commands may be abbreviated.  DIRECTORY is a synonym for LIST.

For each request you make, a transaction log is returned to you
indicating the status of the request.  The status report will indicate
whether the request was successfully completed, and when the file was or
will be sent.   Large files are sent only during off-peak hours.
